# Transfer-Learning
Transfer learning from MNIST number recognition to letter recognition.

Takes a model that was pretrained on MNIST digit recognition and uses transfer learning to identify handwritten letters.
The folder "Images" is composed of 3 examples of each letter, and 1 test for each letter.  If more training images were added the accuracy would vastly improve.
